# tree

Mind map is actually a tree, so you must have a **root node**. The script will determine **the leftmost element** of the selected element as the root element (node is excalidraw element, e.g. rectangle, diamond, ellipse, text, image, but it can't be arrow, line, freedraw, **group**)

The element connecting node and node must be an **arrow** and  have the correct direction, e.g. **parent node -> children node**

# sort

The order of nodes in the Y axis or vertical direction is determined by **the creation time** of the arrow connecting it

So if you want to readjust the order, you can **delete arrows and reconnect them**

# setting

Script provides options to adjust the style of mind map, The option is at the bottom of the option of the exalidraw plugin(e.g. Settings -> Community plugins -> Excalidraw -> drag to bottom)

# problem

1. since the start bingding and end bingding of the arrow are easily disconnected from the node, so if there are unformatted parts, please **check the connection** and use the script to **reformat**
